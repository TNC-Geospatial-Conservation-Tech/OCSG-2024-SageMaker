    "[Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/) is a package for working with multidimensional gridded data in Python. While the package `numpy` provides many of the core operations we need for working with gridded data like indexing  matrix operations, etc it does not provide the functionality to add information about the various dimensions of arrays, the coordinates of grid cells, or attached important metadata. This is where Xarray comes in.\n",

Chunking splits the data into smaller pieces, allowing you to work with datasets that are bigger than your available memory by loading only what you need.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Default chunking and rechunking\n",
    "Some file types like netCDF, zarr or cloud-optimized geotiff have native chunking, and it is usually most efficient to use the chunking that is already present. If you specify `chunks='auto'` chunking will be automatically determined. This is a major advantage as chunking/rechunking can be expensive for large files. The downside is that you are subject to the chunking chosen by the creator of the file. \n",

This enables users to efficiently search for and filter relevant data across large, distributed datasets in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`intake`** is a more general-purpose library that helps manage and access data catalogs in Python. It supports various data formats and types, allowing users to interact with both local and remote datasets in a unified way. With `intake`, we can browse, search, and load datasets without needing to worry about their underlying storage format or location.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools and standards empower users to seamlessly navigate through vast amounts of cloud-hosted data and extract just what is needed for their analyses. By leveraging these metadata-driven catalogs, we can make cloud data discovery efficient, even when dealing with enormous and complex datasets.\n"

    "Even with robust metadata standards like STAC and `intake`, we still need to know where to find the catalogs that contain the datasets we’re interested in. This can sometimes be a challenging task, especially given the vast amount of data available across different platforms and cloud providers. However, there are several excellent starting points for discovering cloud-hosted datasets, particularly those related to Earth observation, geospatial analysis, and open data.\n",

    "Some key resources include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[AWS Earth](https://aws.amazon.com/earth/)**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts a wide range of Earth observation data, making it accessible for analysis in the cloud. The AWS Earth page highlights various datasets related to satellite imagery, weather, and environmental monitoring. It also includes case studies and tools for working with these datasets. This is a great resource for those seeking publicly accessible datasets related to Earth science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/)**: AWS maintains an extensive Open Data Registry, which catalogs a wide variety of public datasets across different fields, including geospatial data, climate science, genomics, and more. The registry provides detailed information about each dataset, including links to the data on AWS S3, metadata, and documentation. This resource is particularly useful for discovering datasets that are freely accessible for cloud-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[NASA Earthdata](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/)**: NASA Earthdata provides access to a vast collection of Earth science data, particularly those collected by NASA's satellites and field measurement programs. The platform offers powerful search tools, including the Earthdata Search tool, which allows users to filter and download datasets based on specific criteria like spatial and temporal coverage, data type, and more. NASA Earthdata is a go-to source for anyone working on climate, weather, land cover, and atmospheric studies, with extensive documentation and tutorials available to help users get started. Much of NASAs data is already on AWS, so using it is simply a matter of finding the url for the data you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Radiant Earth STAC Browser](https://radiantearth.github.io/stac-browser/)**: The STAC Browser is an interactive web-based tool that allows users to browse STAC-compliant datasets. It provides a user-friendly interface to search for geospatial datasets cataloged using the STAC standard. Radiant Earth is focused on providing open geospatial data for machine learning and Earth observation applications, making this a valuable resource for researchers in these fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these resources, discovering the right datasets can still require some trial and error, especially when dealing with specialized or niche datasets. It's important to explore these platforms, understand the types of data available, and take advantage of the metadata standards and search tools they provide to refine your search. \n",
    "\n",
    "As cloud data storage grows and standards evolve, the process of discovering and accessing large, cloud-hosted datasets will continue to improve, making it easier to find the data you need for complex analyses.\n"
